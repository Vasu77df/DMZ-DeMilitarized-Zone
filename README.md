# DMZ-DeMilitarized-Zone
DeMilitarized Zone(network)  is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to a usually larger and untrusted network, usually the Internet. It is an additional network configuration which is deployed for security purposes. It is being used in most parts of the world.DMZ is also used in most tense borders in the world.

Here in this project we will work with Single Firewall architecture. These designs can be expanded to create very complex architectures depending  on the network requirements.

A single firewall with at least 3 network branches can be used to create a network architecture containing a DMZ. The external network is formed from the public network or ISP to the firewall on the first network interface, the internal or private network is formed from the the second network interface, and the DMZ is formed from the third network interface The firewall becomes a single point of failure for the network and must be able to handle all of the  traffic going to the DMZ as well as the internal network.
